# **Sale Management Project**

<p> This case I receive a mail from sales mananager to some requests. He wants  to improve his internet sales reports and want to move from static reports to visual dashboards.
Essentially, His teams want to focus it on how much they have sold of what products, to which clients and how it has been over time. Seeing as each sales person works on different products and customers it would be beneficial to be able to filter them also. They also measure our numbers against budget so he added that in a spreadsheet so they can compare our values against performance. 
The budget is for 2021 and they usually look 2 years back in time when they do analysis of sales.

## 1. Business Request & User Stories


The business request for this data analyst project was an executive sales report for sales managers. Based on the request that was made from the business we following user stories were defined to fulfill delivery and ensure that acceptance criteriaâ€™s were maintained throughout the project.

## 2. Data Cleansing & Transformation (SQL)

To create the necessary data model for doing analysis and fulfilling the business needs defined in the user stories the following tables were extracted using SQL.
One data source (sales budgets) were provided in Excel format and were connected in the data model in a later step of the process.
Below are the SQL statements for cleansing and transforming necessary data.

### 2.1 Dim_Date

```sql
-- Cleansed DIM_Date Table --
SELECT 
  [DateKey], 
  [FullDateAlternateKey] AS Date, 
  --[DayNumberOfWeek],

  --[DayNumberOfMonth], 
  --[DayNumberOfYear], 
  --[WeekNumberOfYear],
  [EnglishMonthName] AS Month, 
  Left([EnglishMonthName], 3) AS MonthShort,   -- Useful for front end date navigation and front end graphs.

## 3.  Data Model

Below is a screenshot of the data model after cleansed and prepared tables were read into Power BI.
This data model also shows how FACT_Budget has been connected to FACT_InternetSales and other necessary DIM 
tables.
